This is a starter React application built with the latest standards and TypeScript. It includes user authentication using Firebase Authentication and a structured folder system for managing various types of documents.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. You can download Node.js and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Firebase account for setting up Firebase Authentication. You can create a Firebase account [here](https://firebase.google.com/).

### Installing

git clone https://github.com/your-username/starter-react-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd starter-react-app
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add your Firebase configuration to the `.env` file.

5. Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage
